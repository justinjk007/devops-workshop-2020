- Opened a bunch of tasks to do
- Installed vagrant and virtual box
- Setup infra with =vagrant up= command

#+begin_src sh
vagrant ssh # ssh into the vm we just made
#+end_src

Vagrant makes a volume mount of the folder we started vagrant in as
`/vagrant` in the vm we made.

- run tests with =nosetests=

#+begin_src sh
python app.py
#+end_src

We have setup port forwarding on vagrant, so the VMs port 5000 should be available on our local host as well.
